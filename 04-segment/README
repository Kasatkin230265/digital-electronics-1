# Lab 4: Seven-segment display decoder

## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

The Nexys A7 board provides two four-digit common anode seven-segment LED displays (configured to behave like a single eight-digit display).

1. See [schematic](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/digital-electronics-1/blob/master/docs/nexys-a7-sch.pdf) or [reference manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/reference-manual) of the Nexys A7 board and find out the connection of 7-segment displays, ie to which FPGA pins are connected and how. Draw the schematic with 7-segment displays.

2. Complete the decoder truth table for **common anode** 7-segment display.
